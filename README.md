# PyGodot

Python and Cython bindings to the [Godot game engine](http://godotengine.org/).

## Work in progress

The bindings are a work in progress. A lot of planned features are missing and the existing APIs are unstable!

This project consists of two parts:
- [**Low level Cython core**](CYTHON_INTRO.md)
- [**Pure Python API**](PYTHON_INTRO.md)
