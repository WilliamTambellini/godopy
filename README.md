# GodoPy

[Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/overview.html)
bindings to the [Godot game engine](http://godotengine.org/)

## Work in progress

The bindings are a work in progress. Some planned features are missing and the existing APIs can be unstable!

## Features

* Compilation of Cython and Python code to GDNative binaries

* Running dynamic, byte-compiled and AOT-compiled Python code from NativeScript extensions

* Two specialized sets (Cython and Python) of automatically generatated bindings to the full Godot API

* Access to the complete official C++ API from the Cython programming language

* Automatic type conversions between Godot and Python types

* NumPy array access to core Godot types


## Installation

* [Python language instructions](PYTHON_QUICKSTART.md)

* [Cython language instructions](CYTHON_QUICKSTART.md)
