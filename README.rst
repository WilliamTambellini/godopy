* Two specialized sets (Cython and Python) of automatically generatated bindings to the full Godot API

* [Cython] Access to the complete official C++ API from Cython programming language

* [Cython] Automatic type conversions between Godot and Python types

* NumPy array access to core Godot types


Installation
