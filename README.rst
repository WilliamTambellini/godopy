Python and Cython bindings to the Godot game engine.

Work in progress

The bindings are a work in progress. Some planned features are missing and the existing APIs can be unstable!

* Compilation of Cython and Python code to GDNative binaries

* Running Python code from NativeScript extensions

* Writing Cython methods that run as fast as native C++ methods

* Two specialized sets (Cython and Python) of automatically generatated bindings to the full Godot API

* [Cython] Access to the complete official C++ API from Cython programming language

* [Cython] Automatic type conversions between Godot and Python types

* NumPy array access to core Godot types


Installation
============

* Read ``PYTHON_QUICKSTART.md`` for Python language instructions

* Read ``CYTHON_QUICKSTART.md`` for Cython language instructions
